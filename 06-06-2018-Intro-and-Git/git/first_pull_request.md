# First Pull Request from GitHub's Interface
Here are the steps submitting your first pull request using the GitHub site to the about_us folder.

## Step 1 - Fork the Repository
Go to the [main repository](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/NYU-Intro-to-Python-Summer-2018) for the class and click the button in the right hand corner that says fork.

## Wait Backup, What is a Fork?
When you are forking a repository you are creating a spin off of my repository that has your own changes. For example, I had a student in the past who used a fork to put their own notes for each class they attended so they can those notes side by side with my class resources.

## Step 2 - Navigate to the Right Spot
Make sure you are inside your fork. This should be your own username and say "forked from JessicaGarson/NYU-Intro-to-Python-Summer-2018" as follows:

From there let's be sure to navigate to the about us file. So click where it says `06-06-2018-Intro-and-Git` and from there `about_us`.

## Step 3 - Add a file
Click where it says `Create new file`, which is the first button of the buttons that are aligned to the right.

## Step 4 - Name your file
Where it says `Name your file` inside the form box be sure to name your file `your_name.md`. Make sure the `.md` is included.

## Step 5 - Write Your Content in Markdown
In the content box be sure to complete to introduce yourself virtually.

The prompt for the exercise was as follows:

Make your name the header and write few sentences about you. Have a sub header for the following:

- Motivation for Being Part of the Class - Why you are here.

- Area of Interest - What you are looking to do after this class is finished. What type of code you do you like to write.

- Fun Facts - write some fun facts about yourself.

- Favorite Movie - what’s your favorite movie?

- Dream Project – if you can work on anything what would it be.

Your code goes here:

Here are some resources to help you write code in markdown:

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Step 6 - Commit Your file
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and fill out the prompt to commit the file. Be sure to click on the green button that says `Commit new file`.

## What is a Pull Request
A pull request allows us to ask the owner of there repository if it's okay to make changes to their repository. I like to think of this a form you fill out to request to make changes to their code.

## Step 7 - Submit a Pull Request
Once your file is committed you will directed back to the main page of your repository. Click on the second tab that says `pull requests`.

![Pull Request Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkibchpur/image/upload/v1528394648/Screen_Shot_2018-06-07_at_2.03.49_PM.png).

From there click on the green button in the right hand corner that says `New Pull Request`.

![New Pull Request](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkibchpur/image/upload/v1528394821/Screen_Shot_2018-06-07_at_2.06.09_PM.png)

Now you should see a window that compares your fork to the master repository. In the middle of the page click on the green button surrounded by the yellow box that says `Create pull request`.

![Create Pull Request](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkibchpur/image/upload/v1528395137/Screen_Shot_2018-06-07_at_2.08.21_PM.png)

Be sure to fill out the form with details about the pull request you are submitting and press the green box that says `Create pull request`.

Congrats! You did it!
